1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**: You can do this by clicking on the ‘+’ sign at the top right corner of your GitHub account and selecting ‘New repository’. Give your repository a name, add a description (optional), choose to make it public or private, and initialize it with a README file if you want.
    
2. **Clone the repository to your local machine**: Use the command `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git` in your terminal or command prompt. Replace ‘username’ with your GitHub username and ‘repository’ with the name of your repository.
    
3. **Add your project to the local repository**: Copy and paste your project files into the cloned repository folder on your local machine.
    
4. **Commit your changes**: Navigate to your repository folder in your terminal and use the command `git add .` to add all the files in the folder to the staging area. Then use the command `git commit -m "Your message"` to commit your changes. Replace ‘Your message’ with a brief description of the changes you made.
    
5. **Push your changes to GitHub**: Use the command `git push origin master` to push your changes to the master branch of your GitHub repository.
    
6. **Check your GitHub repository**: Refresh your GitHub repository page in your web browser. You should now see your project files in your GitHub repository.
    

Remember to replace ‘username’ and ‘repository’ with your actual GitHub username and repository name when using the commands. Also, make sure you have Git installed on your local machine to use these commands. If you don’t have Git installed, you can download it from the official Git website.
